# The first line that doesn't start with a '#' should be the compiler command.
# It should read source code from stdin and produce an executable named
# 'temp.exe'.
gcc -x c -o temp.exe -

After the compiler command, anything not within a test case (surrounded by ...)
is ignored.
The closing ... should be followed by a space and then the desired result of the
test:
* OK if the code should compile,
* BAD if the code shouldn't compile, or
* Any other single line string which the code, when run, should produce.
  Whitespace may be trimmed from the front or back.

...
int main() {
	return 0;
}
... OK

...
int main() {
	puts("5");
	return 0;
}
... 5

...
main() {
}}
... BAD
